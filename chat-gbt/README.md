The First step was asking Chat GPT to create code that has a space theme. It generated basic code, but it needed a lot of tweaking. 
The second step was I asked it to create star animations, it makes them slightly grow. 
I asked it to create a gradient, but I wasn't pleased at first. I specifided and asked it to move like a wave.
Then I tweaked the css and asked it to format it and give it montserrat. Also to add a glowing effect to the text
I asked it to make the cursor be a glowing circle. 
I tried to add a television screen noise effect but I couldn't get it to work.
I wanted to add a carousel, GPT made one and I found images to put in them. I asked it mulktple times for different effects. It needs tweaking but thats currently what I am working on.
